about concepts, that in my opnion are fundamentals for who want to be more than just a computer guy. So betimes 
I'll be doing upload the posts. 
</p>
<p>
Before you read my posts, take in your mind that: I'm Just a guy that love computer and I'm not a PhD
in Computer Science! So take easy if I make a mistake, I'm in eternity learning about this world which 
are Computer Science and Security, and I want to write here about the follows topics:
</p>

* Computer Architecture
* Operational Systems
* Networks and Networks Security
* Algorithm and Data Stucture
* Distribuited Systems
* Software Engineering (Secure Architecture, Software Security, Code review)
* Reversing
* Penetration Test

<p>
This topics are extremely necessary if you want be a professional (or Researcher) in computer systems security,
 since software security, network security or whatever topics which evolves any computer security level.
In general We will explore this topics with posts like short articles, ever walking over the theory behind concepts 
of one way not so deep, but not so shallow. See you guys.
