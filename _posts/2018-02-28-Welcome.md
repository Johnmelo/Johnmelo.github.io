Hello everyone, My name is Jonathas Melo. And Here will be my place where I put and write 
about concepts, that in my opnion are fundamentals for who want to be more than just a computer guy. I'll be using 
this blog to write about my projects and subjects that I've been studying. So betimes 
I'll be doing upload the posts, hope you guys enjoy! 
</p>
<p>
Before you read my posts, take in your mind that: I'm Just a guy that love computer and I'm not a PhD
in Computer Science! So take easy if I make a mistake, I'm in eternal learning about this world which 
are Computer Science and Security, and I want to write here about the follows topics:
</p>

* Computer Architecture
* Operational Systems
* Networks and Networks Security
* Algorithm and Data Stucture
* Distributed Systems
* Software Engineering (Secure Architecture, Software Security, Code review)
* Reversing
* Penetration Test

<p>
These topics are extremely necessary if you want to be a professional (or researcher) in the security of computer systems, walking for software security, network security or any subject that involves any level of computer security. In general, we will try explore these topics with postings as short articles, always going through the theory behind the concepts in a not so profound but not so shallow way. See you later
