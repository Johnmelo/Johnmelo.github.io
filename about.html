title: About Me
---

<p>I am Jonathas Melo, Bachelor in Information Technology from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN in Portuguese), Master student in Systems and Computing at the same institution. I have 6 years of IT experience, working in functions such as technical support, network infrastructure and software developer. Currently, I am doing activities like the IT scholarship at UFRN. Since early I had an attraction for computers, but only around my 12-13 years old when I received my first computer (haha yeah! I live in Brazil and here to buy a computer in 2005 was complicated) that I could finally meet and understand how a computer and its systems work, that made my eyes shine. After that, I started some courses in IT, first focused on assembling and maintaining computers until I entered university, where I knew this wonderful world that is computer science, algorithms and data structures, how a computer is organized (CPU, memory and internal communications), architectures and data sets of an operating system, as well as the systems of calls, threads and processes, is incredible! In this process, it would be natural to want to break and protect systems (hahaha) and this motivated me to study and deepen security concepts such as secure development, web security, vulnerability analysis and other hacking topics.</p>
