title: About Me
---

<p>I'm Jonathas Melo, Bachelor in Information Technology by Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte(UFRN in portuguese), master's degree student in System and Computer in the same institution.
I have 6 years in IT experiences jobs, working in roles like technician support, network infrastructure and software developer. Currently I'm performing activities like IT Analyst scholarship at UFRN.
Since early I had a attraction for computers, but only around my 14-15 years old when I got my first computer( haha yes! I live in Brazil, and here buy a computer in 2005 was complicated) what I could finally know and understand how a computer and his systems work, so it’s make shine my eyes. After this, I started some courses in IT, first focused in computer maintaining until I got into the university, where I know this wonderful world that is Computer Science, algorithms and data structures, how is organized a computer (CPU, memory and internal communications), architectures and set datas of a Operating System as well as the calls systems, threads and process, it is awesome! In this process would be natural wish to want break and protect systems(hahaha) and it motivate me to study and deepen in security concepts, like secure development, web security, vulnerability analysis  and others hacker’s topic.
